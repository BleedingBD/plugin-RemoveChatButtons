# RemoveChatButtons

This plugin allow you to hide all those annoying Chat Buttons that always bothered you. And much more!  
Gift button? Begone! Sticker button? Begone!  
GIF button? I actually quite like that one, so I configured the plugin to keep it.  
But you can choose which buttons to hide and which to keep. Simply go to the plugin settings.  
  
It doesn't stop at chat buttons though, it also adds the ability to hide various other annoying things around the app. Such as the invite button on every channel, voice panel buttons, any DM tabs such as the nitro tab, and much more!
